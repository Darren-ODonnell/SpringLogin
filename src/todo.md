    E1: Update and Edit do not work with React
        The default attribute used for all endpoints was @ModelAttribute - this is suitable for form-data and not JSON data/objects
        Changes to @RequestBody - this now works with add()
        Need to test with other methods in Competition - thenb replicate to other controllers.


# Completed
